Awwdit Privacy Policy

Last updated: Dec 2, 2025

Awwdit is a Chrome extension that inspects the visual styles of the web page you currently have open. We take the protection of your data seriously and want to be transparent about what we do (and do not) collect.

Data collection and usage

No personal data: The extension does not collect, transmit, or sell any personally identifiable information, browsing history, or content from your pages.

Local processing only: All style analysis and live previews happen entirely inside your browser. Results never leave your device.

Local preferences: We use chrome.storage solely to remember interface preferences (e.g., last active tab, whether inspect mode is enabled). This data stays on your device and can be cleared at any time via Chrome’s extension data settings.

Third parties
Awwdit does not send any data to third parties, external servers, or analytics services. The extension runs offline once installed.
